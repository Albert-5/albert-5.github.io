<p>　　<strong>参考范文：</strong></p>
<p>　　Nowadays, there has been a heated discussion as to a better choice between attending college at home and abroad. Views on the topic vary greatly among people from different walks of life.</p>
<p>　　Some believe that it is a better choice to study in domestic colleges, but others consider it better to study abroad. I totally agree with the latter idea for the reasons presented below. To begin with, it harms the society in that the greater the competition is, the higher the recruitment requirements willbecome.</p>
<p>　　Therefore, with experiences of studying abroad, graduates will become more competitive in job hunting. Furthermore, it is beneficial to the students themselves to study abroad. Without the choice to pursue overseas study, many great scholars today would never have achieved such great success.</p>
<p>　　From my perspective, it is crucial that the government should encourage people to pursue overseas study. Also it is crucial that people should understand the meaning and value of attending college abroad.</p>
<p>　　Only in this way can we achieve greater success.</p>

<p>　　<strong>参考范文：</strong></p>
<p>　　In recent years, mobile live video broadcasting has been very popular among young people. People can broadcast their daily life anytime at any place as they like as long as they have a smartphone. In my opinion, there are disadvantages as well as advantages of mobile live video broadcasting.</p>
<p>　　On the one hand, mobile live video broadcasting enables people to show their talent online, which gives them a chance to earn money online. And it is also a good way to share their life experience with their friends and family. On the other hand, if people don’t use their time properly, they may become addicted to it. Particularly, if students spend too much time playing it, they may neglect their studies, which is not good for them.</p>
<p>　　In conclusion, mobile live video broadcasting is a fashionable way to enrich people’s life. However, we should make best use of our time and keep ourselves from being addicted to it.</p>

<p>　　<strong>Importance of Buying a House</strong></p>
<p>　　There is a heated debate on the importance ofbuying a house with the soaring house prices. Those emphasizing the in^ortance of buyiog ahouse maintain that living in your bwn house makes you feel better and more comfortablecompared to that in a rented one. Besides, no investment is more rewarding than buying ahouse nowadays. Statistics from both home and abroad shows that owning a houseguarantees an increase in assets.</p>
<p>　　Quite the contrary, many people say, buying a house is not that important. On one hand,a rented apartment can provide the same comfortable or even better life for people. This isespecially true when many people have no money to decorate their houses after the bigpurchase. On the other hand, peopk can spend more money on other more protitableinvestment than involving in real estate, such as buying stocks or other art poliections.</p>
<p>　　Personally, I think possessing a house is extremely important. At its core, a house is ashelter After buying a house, people will becomc stable. What’s more important is that thctrchildren will also settle and can concentrate on study _ children could get affected as theyadapt themselves with the new places, teachers and creating new friends making them Lagbehind academically.</p>

<p>　　In recent years, Sinology, the study of Chinese traditional culture, literature, history, society etc, has become increasingly popular For instance, it is reported that many primary and secondary schools have set up courses of sinology, in which students are taught classical works by Chinese ancient educators and philosophers, like Confucius- Another good illustration is in the program CCTV Lecture Room famous scholars, e.g, Yu Dan, give lectures on Chinese ancient philosophies and literatures.</p>
<p>　　Sinology becomes prevalent due to the fact that it is of vital significance for both the individuals and the society. For one thing, Sinology is the essence of Chinese civilization with more than 5,000 years. Thus, for individuals, they can enlarge their scope of knowledge, enrich their experience and adapt themselves to the complicated society. For another, it is acknowledged that the rehabilitation of Sinology can contribute to the establishment of a harmonious society.</p>
<p>　　In my opinion, all Chinese people should inherit the merits of Sinology. To do so, we can read books by ourselves or to attend lectures on this issue. Besides, we have the gation to popularize introducing it to the world By doing so, we can not only inherit it but also make it glorious and prosperous.</p>

<h3 id="真题-1"><a href="#真题-1" class="headerlink" title="真题 1"></a><strong>真题 1</strong></h3><p>【题目】<br>　　Directions: Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay commenting on the saying “Seek to understand others, and you will be understood.”You can cite examples to illustrate your views.You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words.</p>
<p> 【参考范文】<br>　　There is a proverb going like this, “Seek to understand others, and you will be understood.” Simple as the saying is, its implication deserves exploring. From my perspective, the real sense of the proverb lies in mutual understanding.<br>　　One of the reasons that mutual understanding is so vital is that it forms the basis of all friendships and relationships. Mutual understanding allows existing differences between two or more partied to be acknowledged, accepted and respected, so that common ground and a collective vision can be found. This is true regardless of whether the relationship is between individuals, businesses or even countries. For example, the US and British governments may not see eye to eye on every issue, but they have been able to put aside their differences and forge a friendship and alliance supported by their shared values. We may not fully agree with other people’s opinions or beliefs. However, by understanding the reasons behind their words and actions, we can learn to “disagree without being disagreeable”so that quarrels are averted.<br>　　Therefore, for those who wish to build lasting relationships, prevent conflict with others, seeking and achieving mutual understanding with others is not only important, but essential. </p>

<p>The Internet, as a platform of the virtual world, has aroused public attention these years. However, in a new Gallup poll, about 100 million Chinese cyber citizens are willing to chat with the other side of the net for several hours, but refuse to talk with their neighbors even for a moment. This deserves our consideration. </p>
<p>  Actually, this phenomenon is prevalent nowadays. There’s no denying that the Internet creates a cyberspace for people to evade the  burden of the real world and find temporary relaxation. People can experience  their own dream and enjoy heartily in the virtual world. For example, an increasing young adults could feel extremely proud of their upper ranks in online games. Nevertheless, it is clear that the more time one spends on surfing, the less time one does with his or her family and friends. If the situation continues, it will weaken one’s bonds with the real life. For instance, it would become difficult for them to fulfill necessary tasks and, more seriously, their individual development would be consequently hampered. As a result, addiction to the virtual world will render a person nothing in the real world.</p>
<p>Obviously, appropriate measures need to be taken. For one thing, the youth should be educated to realize the importance of the real life. For another, their time on online and activities in real life should be balanced.</p>

<p>With the growing of the world wide web, those luckily enough to learn by the net face the decision of e-learning and attending school. The choice is a difficult one as both ways of learning have advantage. Personally, I believe, although e-learning is obviously convenient, the benefits are often not significant and in many ways learning in this kind of way can limit one’s experience. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the conveniences of e-learning include the fact that it easily breaks through the limitations of time and space and offers the update knowledge and lower learning cost. Additionally, it is a more advanced approach to access to essential and useful information. However, the disadvantage of e-learning is clear as well. It cannot allow the students to socialize; namely, it cannot help develop the necessary social skills needed to survive in today’s fast-pace world. Fortunately, this can be fulfilled by attending school. For example, many people meet their best friends while attending school. These friendships are deepened over spending hours and hours in the same classrooms together. Consequently, the bonds that are formed in classroom cannot be replaced by e-learning.</p>
<p>In a word, when combined with other learning methods, such as face-to-face sessions, e-learning is most effective. That is to say, it is a good idea that we combine e-learning and attending school together. No matter what we choose, as college students, we should study more effectively.</p>

<p>At the mention of the robots, many fiction films are rising before my eyes, such as  AI(Artificial Intelligence). I would like to imagine what will happen when an increasing number of robots take the place of human beings in our life. How interesting  the scene is—there’s a robot ready to help you, whether it is helping your mother with household  chores or helping you copy the text.</p>
<p>Clearly, the robots contribute to the progression of human beings’ society. For one thing, they liberate the labor force and promote the industrial efficiency. For another, they are engaged in some dangerous work, protecting mankind from the risks. However, sometimes the robots cause troubles. On the one hand, it will impair man’s innovation ability, if humanity completely depends on the robots for a long time. On the other hand, a single robot can wreck a lot, if robots are given awareness. Hence, if robots are to reach further, there are still much real challenge.</p>
<p>As for me, robots will not take the place of human beings totally, although they would exceed the man in many aspects, such as power of work, operating rate and memory function. Nevertheless, because robots lack the capability of logical thinking and reasoning, it dooms that they can not solve the complicated problems as humans do. Therefore, robots cannot do better than human in many fields, let alone substituting humans.</p>

<p><strong>Equality of Education Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>In recent years the problems which are causedby the inequality of education opportunity haveattracted the public’s attention. For instance, thebackward teaching facilities anddilapidated schoolbuildings in rural areas are in sharp contrast tothose advanced facilities and well-equippedclassrooms in urban areas, students from poor families cannot go to universities because ofthe high tuition.</p>
<p>There are several factors which contribute to these problems. First, the distribution ofresources is unbalanced between rural and urban schools. Second, educational loans for poorstudents are far from enough. Third, the inequality in some schools’ admission policies alsoturns many students away. The education inequality can result in many bad impacts. On onehand, it can affect people’s future employment. On the other hand，it is the root of manysocial problems.</p>
<p>To change this situation, I think, we should take the following measures. Firstly, thegovernment’s spending on education should be increased and the allocation of public resourcesgives priority to rural and weak urban schools. Secondly, the implementation of thegovernment financial aid system for students should be accelerated. Thirdly, the governmentshould speed up education reforms to ensure everyone has equal access to schools.</p>
